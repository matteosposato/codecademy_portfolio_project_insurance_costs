# codecademy_portfolio_project_insurance_costs
This is the repository of the Portfolio Project that I make for test my knowledge of fundamentals of Python

In this project I classified the insurances by region.
Then I found the insurances located in a specific region.
Then, for last, I found, and I printed, the average age of the insurances in specific region (in my project, for example, I used South-East as region interested; but you can also try with North-West, or Nort-East, or South-West)
